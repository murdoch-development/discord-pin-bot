# Discord Reaction Pin Bot

This bot automatically pins or unpins messages in your Discord server based on ðŸ“Œ reactions and provides DM commands to configure its behavior.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```env
TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Discord Developer Portal Settings

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and select your bot.
2. Under the **Bot** tab, enable **Message Content Intent** (required to parse DM commands).
3. Under **OAuth2 â†’ URL Generator**, select the following scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
4. Under **Bot Permissions**, ensure the following are selected:
   - View Channels (formerly "Read Messages")
   - Read Message History
   - Manage Messages
5. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server(s).

## Running the Bot

1. Place the bot code in a file named `bot.js` (see the source code provided in the repository).
2. Start the bot by running:

```bash
node bot.js
```

### On Startup

- The bot loads the configuration from `guildConfig.json`. If any guild is missing from the file, it automatically initializes with the default configuration.
- Context menu commands are registered based on the current configuration.
- The bot begins listening for reaction events and DM command events.

## DM Command Usage

### Enable/Disable Features

**Globally (apply to all guilds):**

```txt
!enable reaction-pin global
!disable context-unpin global
```

**Per Guild (apply to a specific guild by its ID):**

```txt
!enable reaction-pin <guildId>
!disable context-unpin <guildId>
```

Replace `<guildId>` with the target server's ID.

### View Status

Check the current settings for all guilds:

```txt
!status
```

This command returns the current configuration for every guild the bot is in.

### List Guilds

List all guilds the bot is a member of, along with their IDs:

```txt
!list guilds
```

## How It Works

### Event Handlers

- **Reaction Add:**  
  When a user adds a ðŸ“Œ reaction, if the `reaction-pin` feature is enabled for that guild and the message isnâ€™t already pinned, the bot pins the message.
  
- **Reaction Remove:**  
  When a user removes a ðŸ“Œ reaction, the bot checks if any users still have the ðŸ“Œ reaction. If none remain and `reaction-unpin` is enabled, the bot unpins the message.

- **Context Menu Commands:**  
  If enabled (`context-pin` or `context-unpin`), the bot registers context menu commands ("Pin Message" and "Unpin Message") to manually pin or unpin messages.

## Persistence

### Configuration File

All per-guild settings are stored in `guildConfig.json`. The default settings are:

```json
{
  "reactionPin": true,
  "reactionUnpin": true,
  "contextPin": true,
  "contextUnpin": true
}
```

### Automatic Initialization

On startup, for each guild the bot is in, if the guild is not found in the configuration file, it is initialized with these default settings.

## Additional Notes

- **DM Commands:** Allow you to change the botâ€™s behavior in real-time. Any changes are immediately saved to `guildConfig.json` and persist across restarts.
- **Context Menu Commands:** Are registered globally based on the configuration from the first guild (by default) and are refreshed when any context-related settings change.
- **Developer Portal:** Ensure that **Message Content Intent** is enabled and that you are using the correct OAuth2 scopes and permissions when inviting the bot.
